# Conclusion after this profile and investigations

There were so many transactions that the node that got them couldn't send them to all his peers and the miner nodes haven't received them.
There were seen in the mempool of the node that got them, but not in the miner nodes.
So, they appeared as pending transactions, but they will never be mined if the nodes having them don't try to send them again to their peers.
